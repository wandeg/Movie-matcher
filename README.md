An app that allows you to search for movie/tv actors or characters that will basically allow you to answer the question that pops into your head sometimes - 'Where have I seen him/her before?'

Get ratings for the movies of a particular actor and compare them on the basis of genres to see if there's any relation e.g. Do Denzel's movies get better ratings they are action movies as opposed to say, romance flicks?.How much do co-starts influence ratings?
